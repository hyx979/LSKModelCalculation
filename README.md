# LSKModelCalculation

The codes are tested on Mathematica 13.2

## Mathematica codes for calculating the LSK response:

1. Source codes for the 2D Dirac surface state.

2. Source codes for the 3D Weyl semimetal.

## Instruction

1. Open the nb file in Mathematica.

2. Run the codes line by line.

3. Mathematica will output the conductivity expressions of LSK.
